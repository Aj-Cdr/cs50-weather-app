#### Description: Weather app made with html, css, and js that displays the current weather details of your location. Api used for this project is from https://open-meteo.com/. I used a skeleton web framework for a responsive, clean and minimal user interface instead of bootstrap as it makes this too complicated for such a simple application. The minimalism makes it so that there is no memory issued with the program. The open meteo api is a free weather api that provided me all the premium benefits and details needed to fetch current weather details in both celcius and farenheit for people to understand the weather details all around the world. I also made this app mobile responsive so people can use this web app on their phone too. Please check out my project and I hope you like it. --------> Project Link: https://aj-cdr.github.io/cs50-weather-app/
